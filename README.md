## Dependencies

You have a few more requirements to get this project up and running.

First of all, we need to create a local blockchain network.

> You don't have to be afraid, there is something that does it for us quickly :)

- You can download Ganache-UI as Ganache will solve our problem. [Download](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/index.html)
- We need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Globally, we need to install truffle. `npm install -g truffle`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

## Initialization

It is enough to use this command to start the project. <code>npm run start</code>

## Build

TaTaTa... And now we are ready to go into production :)

## Test

I didn't feel the need to write a test for the Component. but you can run the `truffle test` command to run the test of our contract.
